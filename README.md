# Page JS usage on [wp-calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso)

While WordPress.com's calypso runs on React, calypso uses [page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) which is an imperative router framework. This repository recreates the approach wp-calypso uses page.js with React while also providing a live demo of its usage.

The demo pages show a snapshot of the Page data structure on render.
