# Page JS usage on [wp-calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso)

While WordPress.com's calypso runs on React, calypso uses [page.js](https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/) which is an imperative router framework. This repository recreates the approach wp-calypso uses page.js with React while also providing a live demo of its usage.

## How to run this project
1. Checkout the code :  `git clone git@github.com:jdc91/pagejs-on-calypso-react.git`
2. `cd pagejs-on-calypso-react`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn start`



## How it looks
The demo pages also show a snapshot of the Page data structure on render.
